# CEG_FABLESS_RISCV-DATA-MEMORY
This repository contains a team-based implementation of an RV32I RISC-V processor developed by CEG ECE students under the team name **CEG FABLESS DEV**.
Each team member contributes to an independent processor module. My contribution focuses on the **Data Memory block**, designed with synchronous write and asynchronous read operations.
## Contributions
- Data Memory block design
- Addressed load/store operations with clocked write and combinational read
- Designed for easy integration into non-pipelined and pipelined architectures
